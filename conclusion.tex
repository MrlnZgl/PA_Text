\chapter{Conclusion}
1. Can we qualitatively replicate the mechanical responses generated by \acrshort{md} simulations, using \acrshort{fem} analysis? 
2. Can we reliably find unambiguous material parameters to match mechnical responses?
3. In what way influence differnent loading procedures the optimisatio behaviour?
3. For which loading procedures gives the script adequate results? 


\paragraph{Summary}
In this thesis, an optimisation script to find material parameters for epoxys modelled with \acrshort{md} simulations, was developed. The mechanical behaviour of the material should be represented as good as possible through a constitutive model with corresponding material parameters. As constitutive model we use an elastoplastic model with a VOCE-hardening curve to describe the plastification. This model is defined with two elastic and four plastic material parameters. To monitor the quality of the material parameters, we perform simulations with the \acrshort{fem} software \name{Abaqus}. We implemented the whole optimisation procedure a single \name{Python} script, since \name{Abaqus} has an \acrlong{api} which enables the control via \name{Python} commands. \\
Before we start the optimisation procedure, a model with requiered properties is created in the preprocessing. The optimisation is started with an initial guess for the material parameters. With these parameters we perform the \acrshort{fem} simulation, and read out the resulting load reactions. We compare the load reactions with the ones from the \acrshort{md} simulations, which we use as reference data. The deviations are summarised in a single \acrshort{rmse} value. This value is reduced through the numerical Nelder-Mead algorithm, which is able to optimise a scalar function in a multidimensional space. Therefore, the minimisation quantity needs to be a scalar value. The algorithm adapts the material parameters and a new evaluation starts.

\paragraph{Conclusion}
The developed optimisation script is able to minimise the error between the reference data and the \acrlong{olr} through adaption of the material parameters. THe verification study showed, that the optimisation procedure achieves a perfect match of the load reactions for pure tensile loading through a linear strain application. However, the identified material parameters strongly deviate within the test series. We attribute this behaviour to the relatively high number of optimisation variables. Therefore, we predefined the elastic parameters $E$ and $\nu$, and optimised the plastic parameters. With this adaption we can affirm the second research question. in the validation study, the code reliably found similar material parameters independent of the initial value combination. In addition, the \acrlong{omp} agree with the reference values found by \citet{ries_deciphering_nodate}. The studies with sinusiodal load application gave information about the script performance in differnet load cases. The pure tensile loading led to results of similar quality as the validation study, whereas in the shear load case problems about the optimisation of the plastic yield occurred. Possible reasons for this behaviour were discussed in section XX. In the reference data for the cyclic tests, the material properties change during the loading process, which might be explained through arising material damage. Since we disregarded damage models in our \name{Abaqus} simulation, the \acrlong{olr} show high variations from the reference data. The tests demonstrated, that from the tested loading procedures, optimisation of tensile loadings gives reliable results. For the other tested configurations, the results of the material parameters are still arbitrary.


\paragraph{Outlook}
The processing of shear load cases should be part of future investigations. Here, the focus should be taken on the transition from elastic to plastic material behaviour. The tests performed in this work demonstrate problems with the definition of the yield stress, which represents the starting point of the plastic regime. 
For an adequate representation of cyclic loading, a damage model should be included in the \name{Abaqus} model. Due to the unusual material behaviour, a user-subroutine would be necessary to realise this. 
Furthermore, the properties of the numerical optimisation algorithm could be part of further works. In this work, the initial value combinations were picked arbitrary. Since this could facilitate getting stuck in local minima, the impact of the initial value combination on the optimisation process should be studied. In addition, the choice of the numerical algorithm could be reflected. The sensitivity of the algorithm to the initial values could be reduced by choosing a different algorithm. 

% Summary: 
% - script for optimisation
% - md simulations cannot define matrial params

% - fem sim necessary to do thi (continuum based approach)
% - try to fit mechanical behaviour from md sim with const model and corresponding mat params
% - do this via optimisation
% - minimise the diff of the mechanical resp of md and fem through optimisation of mat params
% - via python script in abaqus python interface
% - use nelder mead alg and rmse to reduce diff

% Conclusion:
% 1. yes: verification showed: script minimises rmse, the load reactions match perfectly
% but2: no unique solution for the mat params --> fix elastic params, since only one point in the elastic regime

% 2. yes in validation study: if elast params are fixed, the other params can be determined independent of the initial val combi, except gamma but gamma has only a small effect on the trend of the hardening curve --> not important 

% 3.: verification and validaiton: for linear tensile load works fine 
% tensile: tensile as sin function works too
% shear: yield stress runs into limit in all tests --> difiiculties in finding limit between el and plastic domain
% tensile and shear combined: problems of shear are transferred, and elastic params are not similar --> not possible to match obth curves at a time --> error much higher than before, plot stress strain tens 
% cyclic: works just until unloading stars, because of material damage, cannot represent mat damage, because elastic behaviour is influenced too --> have to write own usersubroutine 

% conclusion: 
% userfriednly: only input file must be adapted 
% everything in one script, automatic data storage
% dynamic adaption for various loading combinations (mult load params, load cases, initial value combinations)
% optimisation script generally works for tensile load application for different load parameters
% for shear load problems at differnetiation between el and plast regime 
% for cyclic damage inclusion
% md data maybe not perfectly suitable

% outlook: 
% - for shear load improvement of differnetiation between el and plast regime 
% - for cyclic damage inclusion
% - more equivalent distribution of reference data points in the domain --> more elastic points
% - ensrue reliability of relaxation procedure for shear loading
