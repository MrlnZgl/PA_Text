\chapter{Introduction}

- epoxys
- MD simulation- not possible to determine Material parameters
- MD very costly
- if only mat params interesting is MD too high effort
- other procedure: fast and reliable results and easy to use
- general description of Mat behaviour through Mat Params
- useful for more general investigations of epoxy behaviour --> more specific applications
- userfriendly in one application



questions of this work: 
- can we implement an optimisation procedure which uses results of MD simulaitons to find material parameters?
- gives the process results for the Material params which lead to mathcing load reactions?
- Is the process independent of the initial values?
- Is the process independent of the loading directions and the trend of the applied load?
(- is it possible find unique mat params which represent the mat behaviour in different loading processes?)
